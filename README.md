## Features:
- gets categories/achievements/criterias from server
- gets character progress from server
- gets achievement earned and criteria update from server
- shows achievements summary, achievements, stats and splash

## TODO and not working addon side:
- stat summary display
- achievement filtering
- achievement tracking
- comparison
- finish conversion of some achievements to vanilla
- movable frame
- game tooltips
- support for more robust ordering (uiOrder with gaps should not break anything)

## TODO and not working server side:
- some achievements like use LFG x times

## TODO and not working database side:
- mask out all non relevant categories/achievements by patch
- update existing categories/achievements/criterias so they become relevant for vanilla
- add new categories/achievements/criterias relevant for vanilla
- write a tool so it will help manage categories/achievements/criterias, validate 'em
